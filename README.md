The DOT (Dependent Object Types) Calculus
-----------------------------------------

The DOT Calculus is a formalization of the Scala programming language focusing
on path-dependent types.

This repo collects a bunch of type safety proofs of the DOT calculus.

## Simpler DOT Calculi

Some simplifications of the [Rapoport et
al.](https://github.com/amaurremi/dot-calculus/tree/master/src/simple-proof)
type safety proof are provided in
[dot-simpler](https://github.com/themaplelab/dot-public/tree/master/dot-simpler)
folder.
